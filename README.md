##Adding the SDK to your Application

In order to include this SDK within your Application simply take the file `ap_sdk.js`, found in the SDK folder at the root level. This file contains the entire SDK code in one file **without** the dependencies like JQuery. Take that file and copy it anywhere you want within you Application folder structure and just include it in your `index.html` using a <scriptÌ£/\> tag.

###Dependencies

All the SDK dependencies can be found in the path *SDK_ROOT/sdk/lib/*, where SDK_ROOT is the folder where this SDK is. You must add this dependencies for the SDK to work properly, however, note that you can download this dependencies yourself if you wish, you don't **have** to use the ones in the lib folder specifically, they are included there as a convenience.

##Setup

To initialize the SDK you must first provide a base URL for your backend server. Then, all you need to do is call the init method on CitiMobileChallengeSdk.

```javascript
AP.baseUrl = "https://www.foo.com";
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.init();
```

If your application is *DirectToSource* then you can skip the base URL setup.

##Using local caching

Local caching can be toggled easily by setting the value of the Application variable `useOfflineCache` **before** initializing the SDK.

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.useOfflineCache = true;
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.init();
```

If you would like to activate it **after** initialization, you can use the method `initOfflineCache` on the SDK.

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.initOfflineCache();
```

Keep in mind that once local caching has been enabled it cannot be disabled in runtime.

##Models

Available Model objects:

* CapitalMarketsActivity
* CapitalMarketsContact
* CapitalMarketsContentService
* CapitalMarketsLogin

* CapitalMarketsRevenue
* CorporatePaymentsAccount
* CorporatePaymentsBeneficiary
* CorporatePaymentsCrossBorderFxBooking
* CorporatePaymentsCrossBorderFxPayment

* RetailBankingAccount
* RetailBankingAccountBalance
* RetailBankingAccountFundTransfer
* RetailBankingAccountTransaction
* RetailBankingForeignCurrency
* RetailBankingLocation

* RetailBankingRewardsRedemption

###CapitalMarketsActivity

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for CapitalMarketsActivity objects are:

* CapitalMarketsActivityActivities

#####CapitalMarketsActivityActivities

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsActivityActivities = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.CapitalMarketsActivityActivities();

// using the query method
CapitalMarketsActivityActivities.query({

  "year": "foo",

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
CapitalMarketsActivityActivities.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

    "year": "foo",

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsActivityActivities.query({

  "year": "foo",

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Collection fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch) documentation for more information.

####Value interpolation

On DirectToSource Models you can specify certain values of the request being made to use string interpolation, but you also need a way of specifying what the context is going to be during that operation.

The interpolation context can be set in more than one way. If you would like to specify a context to be used for a specific call you would do:

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsActivityInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsActivity();
CapitalMarketsActivityInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a CapitalMarketsActivity instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsActivityInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

This way you don't have to set it on every call.

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of CapitalMarketsActivity to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsActivity.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###CapitalMarketsContact

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for CapitalMarketsContact objects are:

* CapitalMarketsContactContacts

#####CapitalMarketsContactContacts

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsContactContacts = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.CapitalMarketsContactContacts();

// using the query method
CapitalMarketsContactContacts.query({

  "client_name": "foo",

  "year": "foo",

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
CapitalMarketsContactContacts.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

    "client_name": "foo",

    "year": "foo",

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsContactContacts.query({

  "client_name": "foo",

  "year": "foo",

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

```
###CapitalMarketsContentService

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for CapitalMarketsContentService objects are:

* CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices

#####CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices();

// using the query method
CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices.query({

  "type": "foo",

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

    "type": "foo",

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

CapitalMarketsContentServiceContentServices.query({

  "type": "foo",

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

CapitalMarketsContentServiceInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

CapitalMarketsContentServiceInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of CapitalMarketsContentService to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsContentService.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###CapitalMarketsLogin

####Create

This is an example of how you would create a CapitalMarketsLogin Model.

```javascript
var exampleModel = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsLogin();

exampleModel.save({ "token": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Here we are setting the attribute `token` in the Model to `"foo"` and then saving it. A complete representation of the Model is always sent to the server, regardless of which attributes you set in the save call.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "token": "foo" }, {
  async: false, // execute this request synchronously
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model save method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) documentation for more information.

####Value interpolation

The interpolation context can be set in more than one way. If you would like to specify a context to be used for a specific call you would do:

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsLoginInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsLogin();
CapitalMarketsLoginInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a CapitalMarketsLogin instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsLoginInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

This way you don't have to set it on every call.

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of CapitalMarketsLogin to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsLogin.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###CapitalMarketsOrder

####Create

This is an example of how you would create a CapitalMarketsOrder Model.

```javascript
var exampleModel = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsOrder();

exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Here we are setting the attribute `id` in the Model to `"foo"` and then saving it. A complete representation of the Model is always sent to the server, regardless of which attributes you set in the save call.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  async: false, // execute this request synchronously
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model save method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) documentation for more information.

####Read

Read operations allow you to get a single CapitalMarketsOrder instance by its primary key.

```javascript
var singleInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsOrder({
  id: 1
});

singleInstance.fetch({
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
singleInstance.fetch({
  async: false,
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-fetch) documentation for more information.

####Delete

In order to delete a single model from the server you can call either the `delete` or `destroy` methods on a Model. Both methods will have the same outcome.

```javascript
// using delete
exampleModel.delete({
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});

// using destroy
exampleModel.destroy({
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});
```

The `success` and `error` callback are optional as with other Backbone CRUD method calls.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
// using delete
exampleModel.delete({
  async: false,
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});

// using destroy
exampleModel.destroy({
  async: false,
  success: function(model, response, options) {...},
  error: function(model, response, options) {...}
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model destroy method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-destroy) documentation for more information.

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsOrderInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsOrder();
CapitalMarketsOrderInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a CapitalMarketsOrder instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsOrderInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of CapitalMarketsOrder to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsOrder.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###CapitalMarketsRevenue

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for CapitalMarketsRevenue objects are:

* CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues

#####CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues();

// using the query method
CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues.query({

  "region": "foo",

  "year": "foo",

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

    "region": "foo",

    "year": "foo",

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsRevenueRevenues.query({

  "region": "foo",

  "year": "foo",

####Value interpolation

On DirectToSource Models you can specify certain values of the request being made to use string interpolation, but you also need a way of specifying what the context is going to be during that operation.

The interpolation context can be set in more than one way. If you would like to specify a context to be used for a specific call you would do:

```javascript
var CapitalMarketsRevenueInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsRevenue();
CapitalMarketsRevenueInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a CapitalMarketsRevenue instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
CapitalMarketsRevenueInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

This way you don't have to set it on every call.

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of CapitalMarketsRevenue to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CapitalMarketsRevenue.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###CorporatePaymentsAccount

####Create

This is an example of how you would create a CorporatePaymentsAccount Model.

```javascript
var exampleModel = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CorporatePaymentsAccount();

exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Here we are setting the attribute `id` in the Model to `"foo"` and then saving it. A complete representation of the Model is always sent to the server, regardless of which attributes you set in the save call.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  async: false, // execute this request synchronously
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model save method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) documentation for more information.

####Update

Updating a CorporatePaymentsAccount Model is very similar to creating one. Updating is done by calling the save method on an already persisted object.

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" });
```

Updating the Model this way will cause a `PUT` request to be triggered, if you would like to send a `PATCH` request instead, then you should call like so:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {patch: true});
```

Just like in Model creation, even if you are not updating all Model attributes, a complete representation is sent to the server.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {async: false});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model save method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-save) documentation for more information.

####Read

Read operations allow you to get a single CorporatePaymentsAccount instance by its primary key.

```javascript
var singleInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.CorporatePaymentsAccount({
  id: 1
});

singleInstance.fetch({
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
singleInstance.fetch({
  async: false,
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-fetch) documentation for more information.

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for CorporatePaymentsAccount objects are:

* CorporatePaymentsAccountAll

#####CorporatePaymentsAccountAll

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var CorporatePaymentsAccountAll = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.CorporatePaymentsAccountAll();

// using the query method
CorporatePaymentsAccountAll.query({

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
CorporatePaymentsAccountAll.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
CorporatePaymentsAccountAll.query({

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {

Read operations allow you to get a single RetailBankingAccount instance by its primary key.

```javascript
var singleInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingAccount({
  id: 1
});

singleInstance.fetch({
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
singleInstance.fetch({
  async: false,
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // after the model has been fetched from the server...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle fetch error...
  }
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Model fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-fetch) documentation for more information.

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for RetailBankingAccount objects are:

* RetailBankingAccountAll

#####RetailBankingAccountAll

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var RetailBankingAccountAll = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.RetailBankingAccountAll();

// using the query method
RetailBankingAccountAll.query({

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
RetailBankingAccountAll.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
RetailBankingAccountAll.query({

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

Refer to [Backbone's Collection fetch method](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch) documentation for more information.

####Value interpolation

On DirectToSource Models you can specify certain values of the request being made to use string interpolation, but you also need a way of specifying what the context is going to be during that operation.

The interpolation context can be set in more than one way. If you would like to specify a context to be used for a specific call you would do:

```javascript
var RetailBankingAccountInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingAccount();
RetailBankingAccountInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a RetailBankingAccount instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
RetailBankingAccountInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

This way you don't have to set it on every call.

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of RetailBankingAccount to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingAccount.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###RetailBankingAccountBalance

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for RetailBankingAccountBalance objects are:

* RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll

#####RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll();

// using the query method
RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll.query({

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
RetailBankingAccountBalanceAll.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

###RetailBankingAccountFundTransfer

####Create

This is an example of how you would create a RetailBankingAccountFundTransfer Model.

```javascript
var exampleModel = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingAccountFundTransfer();

exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Here we are setting the attribute `id` in the Model to `"foo"` and then saving it. A complete representation of the Model is always sent to the server, regardless of which attributes you set in the save call.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  async: false, // execute this request synchronously
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {

    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

####Value interpolation

On DirectToSource Models you can specify certain values of the request being made to use string interpolation, but you also need a way of specifying what the context is going to be during that operation.

The interpolation context can be set in more than one way. If you would like to specify a context to be used for a specific call you would do:

```javascript
var RetailBankingPayeeTypeInstance = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingPayeeType();
RetailBankingPayeeTypeInstance.save(
  null, // passing null means we want to save all attributes
  { // options
    interpolationContext: [
      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

**Note:** the interpolation context is always an *Array* of *Objects*. Those objects will be collapsed into a single Object which will then act as the context, so `[{a: "a", b: "b", c: "c"}, {b: "B", d: "D"}]` will end up as `{a: "a", b: "B", c: "c", d: "D"}`. Note that the Object with the highest index in the Array will overwrite previous ones.

Another way to set the interpolation context is to set it on a RetailBankingPayeeType instance, if you would like that instance to always use the same context you can just set it like this:

```javascript
RetailBankingPayeeTypeInstance.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```

This way you don't have to set it on every call.

The next step is, if you would like **all** instances of RetailBankingPayeeType to use the same context, you can set it in the prototype:

```javascript
CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingPayeeType.prototype.interpolationContext = [{foo: bar}, window];
```
###RetailBankingRewardsCatalog

####Query Scopes

The available query scopes for RetailBankingRewardsCatalog objects are:

* RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog

#####RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog

Get all results that match the given query. You may execute this query scope by calling the `query` method or the `fetch` method.

```javascript
var RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.collections.RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog();

// using the query method
RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog.query({

  "item_category": "foo",

}, {
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});

// using the fetch method
RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog.fetch({
  query: { // here the query is passed as an attribute on the single options hash

    "item_category": "foo",

  },
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

The first object passed represents the field values to match when executing the query. The second object is an options hash, where you can define `success` and `error` callbacks but also a `limit` and `offset` value if you want the query results to be paginated.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
RetailBankingRewardsCatalogRewardsCatalog.query({

  "item_category": "foo",

}, {
  async: false,
  data: {
    limit: 10,
    offset: 0
  },
  success: function(collection, response, options) {...},
  error: function(collection, response, options) {...}
});
```

    ]
  }
);

###RetailBankingRewardsRedemption

####Create

This is an example of how you would create a RetailBankingRewardsRedemption Model.

```javascript
var exampleModel = new CitiMobileChallengeSdk.models.RetailBankingRewardsRedemption();

exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

Here we are setting the attribute `id` in the Model to `"foo"` and then saving it. A complete representation of the Model is always sent to the server, regardless of which attributes you set in the save call.

######Async

This action is asynchronous by default, if you would like to execute it synchronously you can do:

```javascript
exampleModel.save({ "id": "foo" }, {
  async: false, // execute this request synchronously
  success: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle save success...
  },
  error: function(model, response, options) {
    // handle error...
  }
});
```

      {foo: bar},
      window
    ]
  }
);
```

## Development

This sections shows the dependencies and steps to develop or modify this SDK.

### Developing with Grunt

Grunt is a NodeJS-based task runner.  It helps automate common tasks, such as
asset compilation, minification, and testing.  Grunt tasks are included for this
SDK in `Gruntfile.js`.

Follow directions below to get up and running with Grunt.

#### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)

#### Install NodeJS Modules

From the root directory of the SDK (where `Gruntfile.js` is
located), install NodeJS modules:

    npm install

#### Build for Production

To compile assets and create a full production build, run the
build task:

    grunt build

#### Development

During development, a full minified SDK build is unnecessary.  To
compile assets without minifying:

    grunt compile

#### Automatic Compilation & Testing

Since it's cumbersome to manually compile assets after every change during
development, the SDK's `Gruntfile.js` includes a `watch` task.  The
task monitors changes to the SDK's `coffee` and `sass` assets,
automatically compiling (but not minifying) them.  Run the following command
before making changes:

    grunt watch

SDK tests are also executed by the `watch` task.  If changing the SDK
significantly, some or all tests may fail.  You may disable auto-testing by
editing the `watch` task in `Gruntfile.js`.

#### Running Tests

The SDK comes with a complete test suite.  Execute tests from grunt:

    grunt test

Or execute tests directly in a browser.  Open `test/index.html` and click
"Run Tests".
